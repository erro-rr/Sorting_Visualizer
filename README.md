This project creates animated visualizations in order to teach users how various sorting algorithms work. Users can select from several sorting algorithms and watch them run in real time (speed is adjustable). By watching how each algorithm sorts bars in ascending height, users gain a deep and intuitive understanding of the underlying logic of these algorithms and their relative efficiencies.
